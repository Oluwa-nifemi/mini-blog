# mini-blog

Quick blog posts generator I setup with [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/)

# Testing locally

- You can install ghost locally following the instructions [here](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

- Start the ghost server with `ghost start`

- Create a custom integration with [these steps](https://ghost.org/integrations/custom-integrations/)

- Create a .env file and add the environment variables `GHOST_API_URL` and `GHOST_API_KEY` using the values from the created custom integration

- npm install

- npm run dev to build and view the pages

# Requirements

- nodejs

- npm
